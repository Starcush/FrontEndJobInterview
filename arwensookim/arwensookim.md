1. SSR vs CSR
- **SSR (Server Side Rendering)** : request new page to server and refresh the page every request

    - faster initial loading
    - lot of pressure to server

- **CSR (Client Side Rendering)** : manages the routing dynamically without refreshing the page every time the client requests a different route
    - rich interaction
    - not suitable for SEO


#### Difference
- main difference between CSR and SSR is **where** the page is rendering.
